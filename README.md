# plain-dungeon-java-game

The instructions are in game.java

I used eclipse ide for this.

Create a new project 'CS210 PROJECT' and dont create module
Add a package called 'dungeons'
Save the game.java file in 'dungeon' package
Name the class 'game'

Save the word.txt in 'dungeon' package
Find the word.txt in your file directory

It may find it in the order:    
      D:\Users\Your_Name\eclipse-workspace\CS210 PROJECT
      
When you see the word.txt in your folder, copy the directory 
and replace the directory in the format:
      D:\\Users\\Your_Name\\eclipse-workspace\\CS210 PROJECT\\...word.txt

You should be able to run the dungeon game without any issues if done correctly :) thank you for your time
